# ActiveLearning_ImageClassification
Active Learning for Multiclass Image Classification on Fruits360 Dataset

The goal of this post is to help demystify active learning and show how it differs from standard supervised machine learning.
First, what is active learning? Well essentially, active learning is a machine learning framework in which the learning algorithm can interactively query a user (teacher or oracle) to label new data points with the true labels.
The motivation for active learning is a scenario in which we have a large pool of unlabelled data.
Passive learning, the standard framework in which a large quantity of labelled data is passed to the algorithm, requires significant effort in labelling the entire set of data.
